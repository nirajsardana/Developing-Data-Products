##Developing Data Products Course Project Readme
This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization. The app shows the various input options available in R like Text Box, Radio Buton, Check box as well as usage of other options available in R that are used to receive input from the user

The app has been divided into **4 main sections.** The **1st section** is for accepting Personal details of the user and then displays them back on the screen. Options like Text Box, Radio Buton, Check box are used for this

The **2nd section** shows the capability to read a specific data set and then display a subset of it on the screen based on the number of lines that user wants to see

The **3rd section** shows a simple use of Sliders and the **last section** shows the usage of Tabsets. Depending on the user selection of Distribution Type, the shiny app renders the same on the screen.

This repo contains the following additional files:

- **ui.R:** Its used to generate the shiny app
- **server.R:** Used for generating the shiny app
